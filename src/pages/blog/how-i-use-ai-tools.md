I've been coding professionally for over a decade, and like most developers, I've watched the so-called AI revolution unfold with a mix of excitement and skepticism. After experimenting with various tools, I've settled into a practical approach that helps me focus on what matters most: building solid systems and crafting thoughtful user experiences.

## My Daily AI Stack

These days, I primarily use Cursor with its agent mode for most of my development work. It's become my go-to for handling boilerplate code and repetitive tasks. I've found it particularly useful for:

- Introspecting legacy projects & code I did not write
- Setting up new project structures
- Generating test cases (within reason)
- Writing documentation
- Refactoring existing code

For content creation and documentation, I occasionally turn to ChatGPT and Claude. They're helpful for scaffolding technical blog posts or creating social media content about development topics.

## The Human Touch

Despite these tools becoming more sophisticated, I maintain a hands-on approach to the critical parts of development. I still:

- Review all generated code thoroughly
- Write complex business logic myself
- Design system architecture from scratch
- Make final decisions about code organization and patterns

## Why This Works for Me

The biggest benefit I've found is that AI tools handle the repetitive parts of development, freeing me up to focus on:

- System design and architecture
- User experience considerations and visual design
- Performance optimization
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing

It's like having a very capable assistant or intern who handles the groundwork while I focus on the strategic aspects of building software.
